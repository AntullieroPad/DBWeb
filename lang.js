        historyText1: "Despierta Boricua (DB) was founded in 1971 by Puerto Rican students at Yale University. The founders included Eduardo Padró, Manuel Del Valle, Cruz Ramos, Gilberto 'Gilbert' Casellas, and Hector Medina. These working-class, mostly New York-based Puerto Rican men were committed to advocating for the needs of Puerto Rican students at Yale and for the Puerto Rican community in New Haven.",
        historyText2: "DB's initial focus was on increasing the number of mainland Puerto Rican students at Yale. At the time, the majority of Puerto Rican students at Yale came from the island of Puerto Rico and were from upper-class backgrounds. <img src='./OldDBLogo1.png' alt='Old DB Logo' class='about-logo'> DB believed that it was important to increase the representation of mainland Puerto Ricans, who were more likely to be working-class and from public school backgrounds. In addition to their work on admissions, DB also advocated for the establishment of a Puerto Rican studies program at Yale. They believed that it was important for Puerto Rican students to have the opportunity to learn about their history and culture. DB also sought to create an inter-Ivy League network of Puerto Rican students and establish a Puerto Rican cultural center at Yale.",

Her revolutionary voice continues to inspire movements for justice and equality.",
        juliaText2: "Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Julia de Burgos broke boundaries through her poetry that explored themes of feminism, social justice, and national identity.

        juliaText3: "The purple Puerto Rican flag represents this ongoing feminist struggle. Just as Julia challenged patriarchal norms in her writing and life, the purple flag reimagines traditional national symbols to center women's experiences, particularly highlighting the crisis of gender-based violence in Puerto Rico.",

Los fundadores incluyeron a Eduardo Padró, Manuel Del Valle, Cruz Ramos, Gilberto 'Gilbert' Casellas y Héctor Medina. Estos hombres, en su mayoría de origen puertorriqueño en Nueva York y de clase trabajadora, se comprometieron a abogar por las necesidades de los estudiantes puertorriqueños en Yale y por la comunidad puertorriqueña en New Haven.",
        historyText2: "El enfoque inicial de DB fue aumentar el número de estudiantes puertorriqueños del continente en Yale. En ese entonces, la mayoría de los estudiantes puertorriqueños en Yale provenían de la isla de Puerto Rico y eran de clase alta. <img src='./OldDBLogo1.png' alt='Old DB Logo' class='about-logo'> DB creía que era importante aumentar la representación de los puertorriqueños del continente, quienes tenían más probabilidades de ser de clase trabajadora y de escuelas públicas. Además de trabajar en las admisiones, DB abogó por el establecimiento de un programa de estudios puertorriqueños en Yale. Creían que era importante que los estudiantes puertorriqueños tuvieran la oportunidad de aprender sobre su historia y cultura. DB también buscó crear una red inter-Ivy League de estudiantes puertorriqueños y establecer un centro cultural puertorriqueño en Yale.",
        historyText3: "El activismo de DB tuvo éxito al aumentar el número de estudiantes puertorriqueños del continente en Yale y al sensibilizar sobre las necesidades de los estudiantes y de la comunidad puertorriqueña.

Su voz revolucionaria continúa inspirando movimientos por la justicia y la igualdad.",
        juliaText2: "Nacida en Carolina, Puerto Rico, Julia de Burgos rompió barreras a través de su poesía que exploró temas de feminismo, justicia social e identidad nacional. Escribió con valentía sobre la liberación femenina mucho antes de los movimientos feministas de los años 60 y 70, convirtiéndola en una pionera cuyas palabras resuenan con las luchas contemporáneas.",
        juliaText3: "La bandera puertorriqueña morada representa esta lucha feminista continua. Así como Julia desafió las normas patriarcales en su escritura y vida, la bandera morada reimagina los símbolos nacionales tradicionales para centrar las experiencias de las mujeres, particularmente destacando la crisis de violencia de género en Puerto Rico.",
