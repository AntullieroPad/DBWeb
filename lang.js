        historyText1: "Despierta Boricua (DB) was founded in 1971 by Puerto Rican students at Yale University. The founders included Eduardo Padró, Manuel Del Valle, Cruz Ramos, Gilberto 'Gilbert' Casellas, and Hector Medina. These working-class, mostly New York-based Puerto Rican men were committed to advocating for the needs of Puerto Rican students at Yale and for the Puerto Rican community in New Haven.",
        historyText2: "DB's initial focus was on increasing the number of mainland Puerto Rican students at Yale. At the time, the majority of Puerto Rican students at Yale came from the island of Puerto Rico and were from upper-class backgrounds. <img src='./OldDBLogo1.png' alt='Old DB Logo' class='about-logo'> DB believed that it was important to increase the representation of mainland Puerto Ricans, who were more likely to be working-class and from public school backgrounds. In addition to their work on admissions, DB also advocated for the establishment of a Puerto Rican studies program at Yale. They believed that it was important for Puerto Rican students to have the opportunity to learn about their history and culture. DB also sought to create an inter-Ivy League network of Puerto Rican students and establish a Puerto Rican cultural center at Yale.",
        historyText3: "DB's activism was successful in increasing the number of mainland Puerto Rican students at Yale and raising awareness of the needs of Puerto Rican students and the community. DB also helped create a more inclusive environment for all Yale students.",
        historyText4: "DB is still active today and continues to advocate for the needs of Puerto Rican students at Yale and for the Puerto Rican community.",

Además de trabajar en las admisiones, DB abogó por el establecimiento de un programa de estudios puertorriqueños en Yale.
