            <p data-key="historyText1">
                Despierta Boricua (DB) was founded in 1971 by Puerto Rican
                students at Yale University. The founders included Eduardo PadrÃ³,
                Manuel Del Valle, Cruz Ramos, Gilberto "Gilbert" Casellas, and
                Hector Medina. These men were working-class, (mostly)
                New York-based Puerto Rican men who were committed to advocating
                for the needs of Puerto Rican students at Yale and for the Puerto
                Rican community in New Haven.</p>

            <p class="text-wrap" data-key="historyText2">
                    DB's initial focus was on increasing the number of mainland Puerto
                Rican students at Yale. At the time, the majority of Puerto Rican
                students at Yale came from the island of Puerto Rico and were from
                upper-class backgrounds.
                <img src="./OldDBLogo1.png" alt="Old DB Logo" class="about-logo">

                DB believed that it was important to increase
                the representation of mainland Puerto Ricans, who were more likely to be
                working-class and from public school backgrounds.

                In addition to their work on admissions, DB also advocated for the
                establishment of a Puerto Rican studies program at Yale. They believed
                that it was important for Puerto Rican students to have the opportunity
                to learn about their history and culture. DB also sought to create an
                inter-Ivy League network of Puerto Rican students and establish a Puerto Rican
                cultural center at Yale.</p>

            <p class="text-wrap" data-key="historyText3">
                DB's activism was successful in increasing the number of mainland Puerto
                Rican students at Yale and in raising awareness of the needs of Puerto Rican
                students and the Puerto Rican community. DB also helped to create a more inclusive
                environment for all students at Yale.</p>

            <p data-key="historyText4">
                DB is still active today and continues to advocate for the needs of Puerto Rican
                students at Yale and for the Puerto Rican community.</p>
